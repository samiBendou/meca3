# meca3

_meca3_ is a **mechanics framework** :rocket:

It represents **3D space** and provides a **solver** to compute **trajectory** of **moving points** 
:heavy_plus_sign::heavy_multiplication_x::heavy_minus_sign:

It can serve as **advanced physics engine** for animation :coffee:

- **Object oriented** syntax to perform mathematical operations

- **3D optimized implementation** of common algebraical operations to provide fast computation

- **Complete documentation** with **examples** that can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/samiBendou/meca3/wiki/)

### Featuring

- **Linear algebra** common features such as matrix and vectors

- **Geometrical transformations** such as translation or affine transform

- **Coordinates systems** representation such as spherical and cylindrical coordinates

- **Trajectory** representation, transformation and bufferization features for animation

- **Lightweight solver** to perform either step by step or global 2nd order ODE solving with trajectory

- **Points mechanics** features to move a point according to dynamic equation

- **Mechanics of dependent systems** representation with dependent points field
